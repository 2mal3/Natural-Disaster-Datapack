# Natural Disaster Datapack Beta v.0.28.18

The Natural Disaster Datapack adds over 11 different, adjustable and unique natural disasters. These occur in Minecraft over a random period of
one week to one month.
This datapack is still in development, so it is not yet balanced and bugs may occur. Therefore, I am open for more ideas for natural disasters
and other things.
This datapack supports with my [Language Pack](http://adfoc.us/51488274977668) the languages Spanish, German and French.                   
To make this datapack work you need [Datapack Utils](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/datapack-utils/) which you have to download separately and install in your world.

I always recommend updating to the newest version, because the older versions have some big bugs and are no longer supported.Volcanoes can be generated in already generated and built-up areas.                                                                                 
To avoid this, I recommend installing Datapack Utils first and go to the important places and only then install the Natural Disasters Datapack. This way the entered areas will not be regenerated.

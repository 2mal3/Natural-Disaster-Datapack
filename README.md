# Natural Disaster Datapack Beta v.1.1.0
Compatibility: Multiplayer 1.16+

The Natural Disaster Datapack adds over 11 different, adjustable and unique natural disasters. These occur in Minecraft over a random period of one week to one month.               
To make this datapack work you need [Datapack Utils](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/datapack-utils/) which you have to download separately and install in your world.

WARNING: Volcanoes can be generated in already generated and built-up areas.                                                                                 
To avoid this, I recommend installing Datapack Utils first and go to the important places and only then install the Natural Disasters Datapack. This way the entered areas will not be regenerated.

# Natural-Disaster-Datapack Beta v.0.21.16

The Natural Disaster Datapack adds over 10 different, adjustable and unique natural disasters. These occur in Minecraft over a random period of
one week to one month.
This datapack is still in development, so it is not yet balanced and bugs may occur. Therefore, I am open for more ideas for natural disasters
and other things.
This datapack supports with my Language Pack (https://link-to.net/80983/2mal3sLanguagePack) the languages Spanish, German and French.

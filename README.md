# Natural-Disaster-Datapack Beta v.0.8.2
The Natural Disaster Datapack adds over 7 different and mostly unique natural disasters. These occur in Minecraft over a random period of one week to one month.
This datapack is still in development, so it is not yet balanced and bugs may occur. Therefore I am open for more ideas for natural disasters and other things.

Natural disasters:
  - Meteorite impact (All gone.)
  - Thunderstorm (Like a normal thunderstorm only worse.)
  - Disease (A deadly virus. Quickly develop the cure.)
  - Hail (It rains ice.)
  - Drought (Intense heat and everything that goes with it.)
  - Acid rain (Etches the world away and poisons the players.)
  - Doline (A large, collapsing hole in the ground.)
  - Firestorm (Much fire.)

Planned features:
  - Hurricane
  - Cold
  - Language support with my Language Pack
  - Individual setting options for natural disasters
 
 
 Installation:
  - Download the file.
  - Unzip the file.
  - Move the folder in the file to a datapack folder in a world of your choice.

To uninstall, enter /function #ndd:uninstall and drag the datapack folder from the datapacks folder of the world.
